<h2>
Input Data:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
AI systems begin with the collection of data from various sources. This data can be in the form of text, images, audio, or any other type of information.
</li></ul>
<h2>
Data Preprocessing:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The collected data is cleaned, organized, and prepared for analysis. This involves handling missing values, removing noise, and converting data into a suitable format.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Feature Extraction:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Relevant features or characteristics are extracted from the preprocessed data. This step involves identifying key elements that are important for the AI model to learn.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Training Data:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
A subset of the prepared data is used as training data to teach the AI model. This data includes input features and corresponding output labels.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Model Training:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Using machine learning algorithms, the AI model learns patterns and relationships within the training data. The model adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and actual outcomes.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Validation:
</h2>

<ul>
<li>
The trained model is tested on a separate set of data not used during training to ensure its generalization and performance on new, unseen data.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Testing and Evaluation:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The model is further tested on new, unseen data to evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Feedback Loop (Iterative Process):
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
If the model's performance is not satisfactory, the process is iteratively repeated. This may involve adjusting the model architecture, refining features, or acquiring additional data.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Inference:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Once the model is trained and validated, it can make predictions or decisions when presented with new input data. This is known as inference.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data with known outcomes. In unsupervised learning, the model learns patterns without labeled data.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Deep Learning (Neural Networks):
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In some cases, AI models use neural networks, which are inspired by the human brain. Deep learning involves neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) for more complex tasks.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
AI applications such as language understanding and image recognition utilize specialized techniques like NLP and computer vision, respectively.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Reinforcement Learning (RL):
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In RL, the AI system learns by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to improve its decision-making over time.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Ethical Considerations:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Addressing ethical concerns related to bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI models, ensuring responsible development and deployment.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Deployment:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The trained and validated AI model is deployed to production environments, where it can be used for real-world applications, automation, or decision-making.
</li>
</ul>
