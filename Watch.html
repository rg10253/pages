     <ul>
      <li> Unlike in a quarts watch( which is powerd by battery) power in a mechanical watch comes from the mainspring which is stored in a mainspring barrel </li>
      <li>The mainspring (which stores elastic potential energy) is wound by either turning a crown on the side of the watch and tightining the spring or by an automatic system which winds the spring at the movment of your wrist. </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
      <li> coming off the main spring is the center gear then the third gear, the second gear and finally the escape gear. </li>
