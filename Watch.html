    <p> This is a 5 minute video about how mechanical watches work i will sumerise this video into a short list! </p>
    <h2> Power source</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Unlike in a quarts watch( which is powerd by battery) power in a mechanical watch comes from the mainspring which is stored in a mainspring barell </li>
      <li>The mainspring (which stores elastic potential energy) is wound by either turnign a crown and tightining the spring or by an automatic system which winds the spring at the movment of your wrist. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Gear train</h2>
      
      <ul>
      <li> coming off the main spring is the center gear then the third gear, the second gear and finally the escape gear. </li>
      <li>The mainspring berring slowly unwinds which moves it and the whole gear train  </li>
    </ul>
