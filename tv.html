<h2>Input Source:</h2>
<ul>
<li>TV signals are received from various sources, such as cable, satellite, antenna, or external devices like gaming consoles and DVD players.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Signal Reception:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The TV's tuner or receiver processes the incoming signals and extracts the audio and video information.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Demodulation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The modulated signals are demodulated to separate the audio and video components.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Audio Processing:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The extracted audio signal is sent to the TV's audio processor, where it is amplified and adjusted for volume and tone.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Video Processing:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The video signal undergoes processing to enhance quality, adjust color, and handle aspects like brightness and contrast.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decoder (if applicable):</h2>
<ul>
<li>
For digital signals, a decoder may be used to convert the compressed digital signal into a format suitable for display.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Display Technology:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Modern TVs use various display technologies, such as LED, OLED, LCD, or QLED, to produce images.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pixel Formation:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The display consists of pixels that emit or filter light to create the images. Each pixel represents a tiny dot of color.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backlighting (for some displays):</h2>
<ul>
<li>
In the case of LED or LCD displays, a backlight provides illumination to the screen, enhancing visibility.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Color Mixing:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Colors are produced by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue light at each pixel.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Refresh Rate:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The display refreshes multiple times per second to create smooth motion, measured in hertz (Hz).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Aspect Ratio:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The aspect ratio defines the proportion of width to height of the displayed image, commonly 16:9 for widescreen.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resolution:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The number of pixels on the screen defines the resolution, such as Full HD (1920x1080) or 4K (3840x2160).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remote Control:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Users interact with the TV through a remote control, sending signals to the TV to change channels, adjust volume, and more.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sound Output:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The processed audio signal is sent to built-in speakers or external audio systems for playback.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Smart Features (if applicable):</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Many modern TVs have smart features, allowing internet connectivity, streaming services, and integration with other smart devices.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Power Supply:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The TV requires a power source to operate, typically connected to a power outlet.
This list provides a basic overview of the key components and processes involved in the functioning of a television.
