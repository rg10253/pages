<h2>Introduction to Inline Engine:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An inline engine is a type of internal combustion engine where the cylinders are arranged in a straight line.</li>
<li>It is also known as a straight engine.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cylinder Arrangement:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cylinders are aligned in a single row along the engine block.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Combustion Process:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The engine operates on the principle of internal combustion, where fuel and air are mixed, compressed, and ignited.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intake Stroke:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The intake valve opens, allowing a mixture of air and fuel to enter the cylinder.</li>
<li>The piston moves downward, creating a vacuum that draws in the fuel-air mixture.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compression Stroke:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The intake and exhaust valves close.</li>
<li>The piston moves upward, compressing the fuel-air mixture in the cylinder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Power Stroke:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>The spark plug ignites the compressed fuel-air mixture.</li>
<li>The rapid expansion of gases forces the piston down, turning the crankshaft.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exhaust Stroke:</h2>
<ul>
<li> The exhaust valve opens.</li>
<li>The piston moves upward, pushing the burned gases out of the cylinder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repeat Cycle:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The four-stroke cycle (intake, compression, power, exhaust) repeats for each cylinder in a continuous sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Crankshaft and Connecting Rods:
</h2>
<ul>
<li>The reciprocating motion of the pistons is converted into rotary motion by the crankshaft.
</li>
<li>Connecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft, transferring the linear motion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Engine Balance:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Balancing mechanisms, such as counterweights on the crankshaft, are employed to minimize vibrations and ensure smooth operation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cooling System:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inline engines typically have a cooling system, such as a radiator, to dissipate the heat generated during combustion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fuel Injection or Carburetion:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Modern inline engines often use fuel injection systems to precisely deliver fuel, replacing older carburetor systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ignition System:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The ignition system, usually involving spark plugs, ignites the fuel-air mixture at the right moment in the combustion cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transmission Connection:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The output from the crankshaft is transmitted to the vehicle's transmission, which ultimately drives the wheels.</li>
</ul>
